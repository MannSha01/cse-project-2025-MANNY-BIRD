I built it mainly for fun.


**Features**

- Game over screen
- random spawn of pipes




**Tech used**
- python version 12.7

 - make sure you have already installed pygame (open cmd and type pip install pygame)
 - make sure you have the pngs which i hAve uploaded
 - make sure you have random library installed even tho its pre installed


**How to run it**-
- step 1 - copy the source code and paste it in vscode , goolecolab etc.
