# flappy Bird Project Statement

- **Problem Statment**  
  The goal of this project is to build a simple but addictive 2D game where the player controls a bird that has to fly through gaps between pipes. The bird should not crash into the pipes or fall to the ground. The game is endless and gets harder the longer you survive. It's inspired by the original Flappy Bird game, which was popular for its frustrating but fun gameplay. This version is made from scratch using Python and Pygame.

- **Scope of the Projeckt**  
  This project focuses on the core mechanics of Flappy Bird, including bird movement, pipe generation, collision detection, and score tracking. It also includes basic sound effects and pixel-style graphics to give it a retro feel. The game will run locally on a computer and use keyboard input (spacebar) to control the bird. It does not include online features or mobile support. The main aim is to understand how games work and how to use Pygame to make one.

- **Target Users**  
  The game is designed for casual players who enjoy quick and challenging games. It's also meant for students and beginners who are learning Python and want to try game development. Teachers can use it as a class project, and coders can use it to practice working with graphics, events, and game loops. It's not meant to be a professional game, just a fun and educational one.

- **High-Level Featuers**  
  - Bird movement with gravity and flap control  
  - Random pipe generation with gaps to fly through  
  - Collision detection with pipes and ground  
  - Score counter and high score saving  
  - Game over screen with restart option  
  - Simple sound effects and pixel graphics  
  - Frame rate control for smooth gameplay  
  - Basic animations for bird and pipes
